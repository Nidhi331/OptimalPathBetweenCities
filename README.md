# OptimalPathBetweenCities
The aim is to create a realtime flutter app where the user enters source and the destination city , If there is not any direct medium(train,flight, bus) between source and the destination city ,the app should tell the optimal path via which we can reach the destination using some algorithms of graph.


The frontend part is under process , the issue is not getting how to connect railway or airways api to the project.
